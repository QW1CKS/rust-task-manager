## CRITICAL Priority Tasks (Add Before Phase 3)

### Fix F1: Process Store Capacity

**Insert after T078 in tasks.md:**

```markdown
- [ ] T078 [CRITICAL] [PERF] [US1] [US2] Define fixed-size arrays with constitutional capacity: pids: Box<[u32; 2048]>, names: Box<[String; 2048]>, process_count: usize in src/core/process.rs
- [ ] T078a [CRITICAL] Add compile-time capacity assertion: const_assert!(MAX_PROCESSES == 2048) to prevent accidental reduction
- [ ] T078b [PERF] Document memory layout: 2048 processes Ã— ~200 bytes/process = ~410KB for SoA storage (well within budget)
```

**Rationale**: Constitution explicitly requires "2048 processes max" support. Original 1024 capacity is insufficient for enterprise server scenarios (40-core Xeon with containerized workloads).

---

### Fix N3: Mica/Acrylic Material Implementation

**Insert after T045 (rendering loop) in Phase 2:**

```markdown
### Windows 11 Fluent Design Materials

- [ ] T045a [WINRT] [US1] Implement src/ui/d2d/composition.rs with Windows.UI.Composition interop via CreateDispatcherQueueController
- [ ] T045b [WINRT] Create Compositor instance and CompositionTarget for HWND in src/ui/d2d/composition.rs
- [ ] T045c [WINRT] [US1] Implement Mica backdrop: Create DesktopAcrylicBackdrop with MicaBackdrop fallback in src/ui/d2d/composition.rs
- [ ] T045d [WINRT] Apply Acrylic to background panels using CompositionBrush with blur effect in src/ui/d2d/composition.rs
- [ ] T045e [WIN32] Implement OS version detection: RtlGetVersion() wrapper returning bool for Windows 11+ in src/windows/version.rs
- [ ] T045f [US1] Implement automatic degradation: If Windows 10, skip composition setup and use solid color fill, no user notification
- [ ] T045g [P] Add debug toggle to disable composition for performance testing (feature flag: fluent-ui)
```

**Rationale**: FR-043 explicitly requires Mica/Acrylic with automatic degradation. Plan.md mentions `ui/d2d/composition.rs` but no tasks implement it. This is a visible differentiator vs. competitors.

---

### Fix F2: Startup Time Measurement

**Insert after T147 (performance benchmarks) in Phase 3:**

```markdown
### Startup Performance Validation

- [ ] T147a [CRITICAL] [PERF] Create benches/startup.rs measuring cold start end-to-end (process spawn â†’ first UI frame rendered)
- [ ] T147b [PERF] Benchmark Win32 window creation separately: CreateWindowExW â†’ ShowWindow (target <50ms)
- [ ] T147c [PERF] Benchmark Direct2D initialization: D2D1CreateFactory â†’ CreateRenderTarget â†’ first BeginDraw (target <80ms)
- [ ] T147d [PERF] Benchmark initial data collection: First NtQuerySystemInformation + PDH collection (target <100ms)
- [ ] T147e [PERF] Benchmark first frame render: BeginDraw â†’ EndDraw â†’ Present (target <16ms)
- [ ] T147f [PERF] Add startup timeline instrumentation: Emit events for WinMain entry, window created, D2D ready, data loaded, first paint
- [ ] T147g [CRITICAL] Validate sum of components <500ms per SC-001, fail CI if exceeded by >10%
- [ ] T147h [P] Add startup flamegraph generation for optimization: cargo flamegraph --bench startup
```

**Rationale**: SC-001 requires <500ms cold start (constitution's primary performance claim). Cannot validate without component-level measurement. Plan shows budget breakdown but no enforcement.

---

### Fix G1: Per-Monitor DPI v2 Full Implementation

**Insert after T050 in Phase 2:**

```markdown
### Per-Monitor DPI v2 Complete Implementation

- [ ] T050a [WIN32] Set DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2 in application manifest (build.rs generates manifest)
- [ ] T050b [WIN32] Implement non-client area DPI scaling: Override WM_NCCALCSIZE to adjust title bar/borders per monitor DPI
- [ ] T050c [CRITICAL] Implement DPI virtualization for child controls: Propagate DPI changes to all Control trait implementers
- [ ] T050d [PERF] Scale Direct2D resources per-monitor: Recreate brushes, fonts, geometries at new DPI in d2d/resources.rs
- [ ] T050e [WIN32] Implement icon resource scaling: Load appropriate icon size (16x16 @ 96 DPI â†’ 24x24 @ 144 DPI) from resources
- [ ] T050f [WIN32] Add DPI change animation: Smooth transition over 200ms when window moves between monitors (optional polish)
- [ ] T050g [CRITICAL] Add integration test: Move window between 96 DPI and 144 DPI monitors, verify no visual artifacts or incorrect scaling
```

**Rationale**: FR-047 requires full per-monitor DPI v2 support. Tasks T024/T049 only handle basic WM_DPICHANGED. Missing non-client area, child window propagation, and resource scaling will cause blurry UI on mixed-DPI setups.

---

### Fix A1: Data Ownership Between SystemMonitor and ProcessStore

**Insert after T133 in Phase 3:**

```markdown
### Data Flow and Ownership Specification

- [ ] T133a [CRITICAL] Define ProcessSnapshot struct in src/core/process.rs: Contains Vec<ProcessInfo> with timestamp, transferred from SystemMonitor to ProcessStore
- [ ] T133b Document ownership model: SystemMonitor produces ProcessSnapshot (allocates), ProcessStore::update() consumes (takes ownership), no shared mutable state
- [ ] T133c [PERF] Implement ProcessInfo struct: Contains only essential fields (PID, name, CPU%, memory) sized for cache efficiency (~64 bytes)
- [ ] T133d Add transformation layer: SystemMonitor::collect_all() returns Result<ProcessSnapshot>, ProcessStore::update(snapshot) updates SoA arrays
- [ ] T133e [PERF] Optimize transfer: Use Box::leak() pattern to transfer Vec ownership without reallocation, ProcessStore takes raw pointer and reconstructs Box
- [ ] T133f Document error handling: If collect_all() fails, ProcessStore retains previous state, UI shows last-known-good data with staleness indicator
```

**Rationale**: Analysis finding A1 identified circular dependency risk. SystemMonitor collects raw data, ProcessStore organizes for rendering. Clear ownership prevents dangling references and enables zero-copy transfer.

## Safety Contract Templates

**For all UNSAFE tasks (G8), add this documentation pattern:**

```rust
/// SAFETY CONTRACT TEMPLATE - Add to all unsafe blocks
/// 
/// # Safety Requirements
/// 
/// This unsafe block is permitted under Constitution Â§IV.5 for [reason]:

/// ## Pre-conditions (What must be true before calling)
/// 1. [Example: `process_handle` must be a valid HANDLE returned from OpenProcess]
/// 2. [Example: `buffer` must point to at least `buffer_size` bytes of writable memory]
/// 3. [Example: `process_id` must be a currently running process]
///
/// ## API Guarantees (What the Windows API guarantees)
/// 1. [Example: NtQuerySystemInformation will not write beyond `buffer_size` bytes]
/// 2. [Example: The returned status code indicates success or specific error]
/// 3. [Example: The function is thread-safe per Microsoft documentation]
///
/// ## Post-conditions (What is guaranteed after calling)
/// 1. [Example: If STATUS_SUCCESS, buffer contains valid SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION]
/// 2. [Example: If STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH, required size written to `return_length`]
/// 3. [Example: No Rust safety invariants are violated (no dangling references)]
///
/// ## Performance Justification (Constitution Â§IV.5)
/// This unsafe code provides [X]% performance improvement over safe alternatives:
/// - [Example: Measured via benchmark benches/nt_query.rs]
/// - [Example: Baseline (safe): 15ms, Optimized (unsafe): 5ms = 67% faster]

///
/// ## Testing & Validation
/// - [ ] Miri validation: cargo +nightly miri test [test_name]
/// - [ ] Fuzz testing: cargo +nightly fuzz run [fuzz_target] (if applicable)
/// - [ ] Two-person review: Reviewed by [Name] on [Date]
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```rust
/// let buffer = vec![0u8; 1024];
/// // SAFETY: Buffer is valid for 1024 bytes, NtQuerySystemInformation
/// // guaranteed not to write beyond length, status code checked for errors
/// let status = unsafe {
///     NtQuerySystemInformation(
///         SystemProcessInformation,
///         buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut _,
///         buffer.len() as u32,
///         &mut return_length
///     )
/// };

///     return Err(Error::NtStatusError(status));
/// }
/// ```

## Unsafe Code Documentation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All tasks marked [UNSAFE] MUST include safety contracts per Constitution Â§IV.

### Safety Contract Checklist (Required for EVERY unsafe block)

- [ ] Reason for unsafe (select one): FFI / Zero-copy / SIMD / Allocator / Lock-free
- [ ] Pre-conditions documented (what must be true before calling)
- [ ] API guarantees documented (what Windows API guarantees)
- [ ] Post-conditions documented (what is guaranteed after calling)  
- [ ] Performance justification (>20% improvement, measured via benchmark)
- [ ] Miri validation test written and passing
- [ ] Two-person code review completed

### Example: NtQuerySystemInformation Safety Contract

```rust
// SAFETY: This FFI call to NtQuerySystemInformation is safe because:
// 1. Pre-condition: `buffer` is a valid Box<[u8]> with known length
// 2. API guarantee: Windows will not write beyond `buffer.len()` bytes
// 3. Post-condition: If STATUS_SUCCESS, buffer contains valid data
// 4. Performance: 67% faster than EnumProcesses (benches/nt_query.rs)
// 5. Validated: Miri passes on tests/nt_query_miri.rs
// 6. Reviewed: @reviewer-name on 2025-10-15
unsafe {
    NtQuerySystemInformation(
        SystemProcessInformation,
        buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut c_void,
        buffer.len() as u32,
        &mut return_length
    )
}
```

### Enforcement

- CI checks for "SAFETY:" comments in all unsafe blocks (regex: `unsafe\s*\{` without preceding `//\s*SAFETY:` within 10 lines)
- PR review checklist requires safety contract verification
- Miri run in CI for all unsafe code paths
```

## Test Coverage Requirements (G9)

**Add after T020 in Phase 1:**

```markdown
### Code Coverage Infrastructure

- [ ] T020a [P] Install cargo-llvm-cov: cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
- [ ] T020b Configure coverage in .cargo/config.toml: Set RUSTFLAGS for coverage instrumentation
- [ ] T020c [CRITICAL] Add coverage CI job: Run cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path coverage.lcov
- [ ] T020d [CRITICAL] Configure coverage thresholds: Fail CI if line coverage <85% or branch coverage <80%
- [ ] T020e [P] Exclude FFI wrappers from coverage: Use #[coverage(off)] attribute on pure FFI wrappers (tested via integration tests)
- [ ] T020f [P] Upload coverage to Codecov: curl -s https://codecov.io/bash | bash (if public repo)
- [ ] T020g Add coverage badge to README.md: ![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/.../badge.svg)
```

---

## Performance Verification Methods (L3, L4)

**Move to Phase 1 and add early validation:**

```markdown
### Early Performance Baseline (Add to Phase 1)

- [ ] T019a [CRITICAL] [PERF] Create benches/baseline.rs with stub benchmarks for all hot paths (even before implementation)
- [ ] T019b [PERF] Benchmark baseline: Empty process enumeration loop (target: <1ms for loop overhead)
- [ ] T019c [PERF] Benchmark baseline: Empty render frame (BeginDraw â†’ EndDraw, target: <1ms)
- [ ] T019d [PERF] Benchmark baseline: Channel send/receive (target: <100Î¼s)
- [ ] T019e [CRITICAL] Set Criterion baseline: cargo bench -- --save-baseline phase1
- [ ] T019f Configure CI: Run cargo bench on every PR, fail if >10% regression vs. saved baseline
- [ ] T019g [P] Add performance dashboard: Generate flamegraphs on regression, upload to GitHub Actions artifacts

### Vertical Slice Demo (Add after Phase 2)

- [ ] T145b [CRITICAL] Create examples/vertical_slice.rs: Minimal demo combining window + monitoring + rendering
- [ ] T145c Implement simple demo: Display "CPU: 45.2%" in window title bar, update every second
- [ ] T145d Validate complete pipeline: Window creation â†’ monitoring thread â†’ mpsc channel â†’ UI update â†’ render cycle
- [ ] T145e [PERF] Benchmark vertical slice: Measure end-to-end latency (metric collected â†’ displayed), target <100ms
- [ ] T145f Demo to stakeholders: Show working application (even if basic) to validate architecture early
```

---

## Configuration Persistence (G10)

**Add to Phase 4:**

```markdown
### Settings & Preferences Persistence (Addresses FR-048, FR-063)

- [ ] T279 [CRITICAL] Create src/app/config.rs with Config struct containing all user preferences
- [ ] T280 Define Config fields: theme (Light/Dark/System), refresh_rate_ms, window_pos, window_size, visible_columns, column_widths, zoom_factor
- [ ] T281 [WIN32] Implement registry persistence: Save to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\RustTaskManager\Settings
- [ ] T282 [WIN32] Implement load_config(): Read from registry on startup, use defaults if key missing
- [ ] T283 [WIN32] Implement save_config(): Write to registry on setting change and application exit
- [ ] T284 [P] Handle registry errors: If registry write fails, fall back to in-memory only (log warning)
- [ ] T285 [P] Add config migration: Detect old config version, migrate to new schema (add version number to registry)
- [ ] T286 [PERF] Validate SC-013: Measure time from app startup to config loaded and applied, target <100ms
```
