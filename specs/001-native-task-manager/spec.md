- Q: Which rendering technology should be used for hardware-accelerated graphics? → A: Direct2D 1.1+ - Hardware-accelerated 2D rendering, native Windows composition integration, optimal for graphs and UI
- Q: How should Windows 11-exclusive features be handled on Windows 10 systems? → A: Automatic graceful degradation - Detect OS version at runtime, enable Mica/Acrylic on Windows 11, use solid colors on Windows 10, no warnings or user notification
- Q: What are the maximum supported system scale limits for processes and CPU cores? → A: Enterprise limits - 2048 processes max, 256 CPU cores max (high-end server/workstation)
- Q: How should the application handle errors and provide diagnostics for troubleshooting? → A: Local diagnostics - Write error logs to %LOCALAPPDATA%, generate minidump on crash, integrate with Windows Event Log, no automatic telemetry upload

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-Time System Monitoring (Priority: P1)

A system administrator needs to quickly diagnose performance issues on a production Windows server. They launch the task manager and immediately see live CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics updating in real-time with minimal system overhead.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - without real-time monitoring, the application has no purpose. This is the foundation upon which all other features are built.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the application and verifying that system metrics (CPU percentage, memory usage, disk activity, network throughput) update continuously with visible changes when system load varies. Delivers immediate value as a system monitoring tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the task manager is launched without admin privileges, **When** the main window opens, **Then** CPU usage for all cores, total memory consumption, disk read/write rates, and network upload/download rates are displayed and update at least once per second
2. **Given** system metrics are being displayed, **When** a user starts a CPU-intensive task (e.g., video encoding), **Then** CPU usage increases visibly within 100ms and the responsible process appears in the process list
3. **Given** the application is running on a system with 16+ CPU cores, **When** viewing CPU metrics, **Then** per-core usage is displayed with individual percentages and core frequencies
4. **Given** the task manager has been running for 5 minutes, **When** viewing performance graphs, **Then** historical data for the past 5 minutes is visible with smooth, interpolated curves

---

### User Story 2 - Process Management and Control (Priority: P1)

A developer notices their application is consuming excessive memory. They open the task manager, quickly locate their process in a list of 500+ running processes, examine its memory working set and page faults, and terminate it to free resources.

**Why this priority**: Process management is the second core function users expect. Combined with monitoring (P1), this forms the minimal viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application, searching/filtering for a specific process, viewing its detailed metrics, and terminating it. Delivers immediate value as a process management tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 1000+ processes are running on the system, **When** the process list loads, **Then** all processes appear within 50ms with their name, PID, CPU usage, and memory consumption
2. **Given** the process list is displayed, **When** a user types "chrome" in a filter box, **Then** only processes matching "chrome" are shown in real-time as they type
3. **Given** a user has selected a process, **When** they view detailed information, **Then** the process's memory working set, private bytes, commit charge, thread count, handle count, and security context (integrity level) are displayed
4. **Given** a user has selected their own process, **When** they click "End Process", **Then** the process terminates within 500ms and disappears from the list
5. **Given** a user has selected a system-protected process without admin rights, **When** they attempt to terminate it, **Then** a clear message explains that elevation is required and offers to restart with admin privileges

---

### User Story 3 - Performance Visualization (Priority: P2)

A performance analyst investigating intermittent slowdowns needs to correlate CPU spikes with specific processes over time. They configure the task manager to show 1-hour historical graphs and identify patterns showing a background service causing periodic load.

**Why this priority**: Advanced monitoring capability that enhances troubleshooting but isn't required for basic usage. Builds on P1 monitoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring graph history length, running the application for the specified duration, and verifying that historical data is retained and visualized correctly. Delivers value for performance analysis and troubleshooting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the task manager is displaying performance graphs, **When** a user configures history length to 1 hour, **Then** graphs expand to show the full hour with appropriate time axis labels
2. **Given** performance graphs are showing multi-core CPU usage, **When** rendering at high refresh rates, **Then** graphs maintain 60+ FPS with smooth animations even with 144Hz displays
3. **Given** the user is viewing CPU graphs, **When** hovering over any point on the timeline, **Then** a tooltip shows the exact timestamp, CPU percentage, and top processes consuming CPU at that moment
4. **Given** multiple metrics are being graphed simultaneously, **When** a user clicks a data point, **Then** all graphs synchronize to show data from that exact timestamp
5. **Given** performance data has been collected, **When** a user selects "Export Data", **Then** the full historical dataset exports to CSV format with timestamp, metric name, and value columns

---

### User Story 4 - Boot Performance Analysis (Priority: P3)

A user experiencing slow boot times opens the task manager's startup tab to identify applications delaying system startup. They see each autorun application ranked by startup impact and disable the heaviest offenders.

**Why this priority**: Valuable diagnostic feature but not required for core monitoring/management functions. Enhances the product but users can accomplish basic tasks without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the startup tab, viewing the list of autorun applications with impact scores, disabling an application, rebooting, and verifying it no longer runs at startup. Delivers value for boot optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the startup tab is opened, **When** the application loads autorun entries, **Then** all startup applications from Registry Run keys, Startup folder, Task Scheduler, and Services are listed with their name, publisher, and startup impact rating (High/Medium/Low/None)
2. **Given** startup applications are displayed with impact ratings, **When** a user views an application rated "High", **Then** detailed metrics show boot delay time in milliseconds and disk/CPU usage during startup
3. **Given** a user has selected a startup application, **When** they click "Disable", **Then** the application is disabled from autorun and the change takes effect on next reboot
4. **Given** the user has disabled multiple startup items, **When** they reboot the system, **Then** boot time improves measurably and disabled items no longer appear in startup process traces

---

### User Story 5 - Advanced System Diagnostics (Priority: P3)

A hardware enthusiast monitoring system stability wants detailed sensor data. They view GPU memory allocation per process, CPU thermal throttling events, storage SMART health status, and per-disk IOPS to ensure their overclocked system runs reliably.

**Why this priority**: Power-user feature targeting enthusiasts and advanced diagnostics. Enhances value proposition but not required for mainstream users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to hardware diagnostic views, verifying sensor data displays correctly (GPU usage, temperatures, storage health), and correlating values with third-party monitoring tools. Delivers value for hardware monitoring and system health validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the task manager is running on a system with NVIDIA/AMD GPU, **When** viewing GPU monitoring, **Then** dedicated GPU memory usage, shared memory usage, GPU engine utilization (3D vs. compute vs. video decode), and per-process GPU memory allocation are displayed
2. **Given** the CPU is thermal throttling, **When** viewing CPU details, **Then** a warning indicator shows throttling is active and the current vs. maximum frequency for each core is displayed
3. **Given** the system has NVMe drives with SMART support, **When** viewing storage details, **Then** SMART attributes including temperature, wear leveling count, total bytes written, and health status are displayed for each drive
4. **Given** network connections are active, **When** viewing network tab, **Then** individual TCP/UDP connections show local/remote addresses, ports, protocol, state, and per-connection bytes sent/received with associated process name

---

### User Story 6 - Service and Driver Management (Priority: P3)

An IT administrator troubleshooting a system issue needs to identify which Windows service is causing problems. They view all services with dependencies, stop a problematic service, and analyze which drivers are consuming excessive CPU during interrupt handling.

**Why this priority**: Specialized administrative feature. Most users never interact with services directly. Valuable for IT professionals but not core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to services tab, viewing service status and dependencies, stopping/starting a service, and verifying the operation succeeds with appropriate permissions. Delivers value for system administration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the services tab is opened, **When** services are enumerated, **Then** all Windows services display with name, status (Running/Stopped), startup type (Automatic/Manual/Disabled), and description
2. **Given** a user selects a service, **When** viewing dependencies, **Then** a tree diagram shows which services depend on this service and which services it depends on
3. **Given** a user has admin privileges, **When** they stop a running service, **Then** the service stops within 5 seconds (or shows a timeout warning) and dependent services are warned about impact
4. **Given** the drivers view is opened, **When** viewing driver details, **Then** all loaded kernel drivers show with name, version, file path, load address, size, and CPU time spent in driver code

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the application runs on a system with 2000+ processes? (Performance must not degrade beyond limits; gracefully handle up to 2048 processes maximum with <50ms enumeration time)
- What happens on systems with unusual configurations (up to 256 CPU cores, 512GB+ RAM, 10+ GPUs)? (UI scales appropriately; fixed buffer sizes accommodate maximum supported limits)
- How does the system handle processes that terminate during enumeration? (Gracefully skip without errors)
- What happens when a user attempts privileged operations without admin rights? (Clear message with option to elevate)
- How does the application behave when Windows APIs fail or return incomplete data? (Fallback to alternative data sources; show partial data with indicators for unavailable metrics)
- What happens on systems with unusual configurations (32+ cores, 512GB+ RAM, 10+ GPUs)? (UI scales appropriately; no hardcoded limits)
- How does the system handle very long process names or paths (>260 characters)? (Truncate with tooltips showing full text)
- What happens when monitoring hardware that doesn't expose standard sensors (older GPUs, RAID controllers)? (Gracefully disable unsupported features; show only available metrics)
- How does the application respond to DPI changes while running (moving between monitors with different scaling)? (Instant re-rendering at correct DPI without restart)
- What happens when system memory is critically low? (Reduce history buffer sizes; disable animations; maintain core functionality)

## Assumptions

1. **Target Hardware**: Assumes typical modern Windows PC with quad-core or better CPU, 8GB+ RAM, SSD storage, and DirectX 11+ compatible GPU. Lower-spec systems may not meet all performance targets.

2. **Windows Version Distribution**: Assumes primary deployment on Windows 10 (1809+) and Windows 11. Windows 11-specific features (Mica materials, updated Fluent design) automatically degrade to solid colors on Windows 10 without user notification.

3. **Administrative Context**: Assumes most users will run initially without administrative privileges but may choose to elevate for advanced features. All core functionality must work without elevation.

4. **Display Configuration**: Assumes standard desktop configurations with 1-3 monitors, 1080p-4K resolution, and 100%-200% DPI scaling. Edge cases (10+ monitors, 8K resolution) may have degraded performance.

5. **System Language**: Assumes English (US) as primary language with standard ASCII process names and paths. Unicode support provided but not optimized for complex scripts (Arabic, Chinese, etc.).

6. **GPU Availability**: Assumes dedicated GPU presence for GPU monitoring features. Systems with integrated-only graphics will show limited GPU metrics.

7. **Network Environment**: Assumes standard home/office network configurations. Complex enterprise networks with extensive firewall rules or unusual network stack configurations may show incomplete network connection data.

8. **Sensor Support**: Assumes standard sensor hardware (thermal sensors, SMART-capable drives). Older hardware or enterprise storage controllers without sensor support will show unavailable for related metrics.

9. **Performance Targets**: All performance budgets (startup time, memory, CPU usage) assume typical consumer hardware (Core i5/Ryzen 5 equivalent, NVMe SSD). Slower hardware may exceed budgets but must maintain functionality.

10. **ETW Availability**: Assumes Windows ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) is enabled for boot analysis features. Systems with ETW disabled will have limited boot performance analysis capabilities.

11. **Update Frequency**: Default 1Hz refresh rate assumed optimal for most users. Power users may increase to 10Hz; users concerned with overhead may decrease to 0.1Hz.

12. **User Expertise**: Assumes users have basic Windows knowledge (understanding processes, services, CPU/memory concepts). Advanced features (drivers, ETW, SMART status) target power users and IT professionals.

## Dependencies

1. **Windows API Availability**: Requires Windows 10 1809+ APIs for full functionality. Specific API dependencies include:
   - Process enumeration: `NtQuerySystemInformation`, `EnumProcesses`
   - Performance data: Performance Counters (PDH), WMI
   - GPU metrics: DXGI, DirectX diagnostics
   - Network connections: IP Helper API (`GetExtendedTcpTable`, `GetExtendedUdpTable`)
   - ETW integration: Event Tracing for Windows APIs

2. **Graphics Stack**: Requires DirectX 11+ capable GPU and drivers for Direct2D 1.1+ hardware-accelerated rendering. Software fallback available but performance targets not guaranteed.

3. **Security Privileges**: Full functionality requires:
   - Standard user: Process enumeration, resource monitoring, user-owned process control
   - SeDebugPrivilege (admin): System process details, all process termination
   - SeLoadDriverPrivilege (admin): Driver management features

4. **Windows Components**: Requires:
   - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service running
   - Performance Counter (PDH) service running  
   - Event Log service for ETW integration

5. **External Standards**: Conforms to:
   - Windows UI Automation (UIA) for accessibility
   - Windows Accessibility Guidelines for keyboard navigation
   - Per-monitor DPI v2 awareness standards

## Out of Scope

The following capabilities are explicitly excluded from this specification:

1. **Remote Monitoring**: No support for monitoring remote systems over network. Application monitors only the local machine.

2. **Historical Data Persistence**: Performance data is kept only in memory for the configured retention period (max 24 hours). No database persistence or multi-day historical analysis.

3. **Alerting and Notifications**: No proactive alerts when thresholds are exceeded. Application is a real-time monitoring tool, not an alerting system.

4. **Process Automation**: No scripting, automation, or scheduled actions. Users must interact manually for all operations.

5. **System Modification**: Beyond process termination and service start/stop, no system modification capabilities. No registry editing, file operations, or system configuration changes.

6. **Malware Detection**: No security scanning, malware detection, or behavioral analysis. Application displays metrics but does not analyze for security threats.

7. **Performance Tuning**: No automatic optimization or performance tuning recommendations. Application provides data; users make decisions.

8. **Cloud Integration**: No cloud backup, cloud sync, or automatic telemetry upload. Application is fully offline and local. Error logs and crash dumps are stored locally only.

9. **Mobile Platforms**: Windows desktop only. No iOS, Android, or web interface.

10. **Virtualization Management**: No hypervisor integration or VM-specific monitoring. VMs are treated as processes.

11. **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows-only. No Linux or macOS versions planned.

12. **Plugin System** (Initial Release): While architecture supports future plugins, initial release has no plugin API or third-party extensions.

13. **Advanced Debugging**: No debugger integration, memory dump analysis, or crash dump viewing. Users should use dedicated debugging tools.

14. **Network Packet Analysis**: Network monitoring shows connection statistics only. No packet capture, protocol analysis, or deep packet inspection.

15. **Overclocking Controls**: Displays sensor data (frequencies, temperatures, voltages) but provides no controls to modify hardware settings.
