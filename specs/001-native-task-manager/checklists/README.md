# Quality Checklists - Master Index

**Feature**: Native High-Performance Task Manager  
**Spec Reference**: `../spec.md`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive quality checklists for validating requirement quality across all aspects of the native Windows task manager specification. These checklists serve as "unit tests for requirements" - ensuring requirements are **complete**, **clear**, **consistent**, **measurable**, and **testable** before implementation begins.

## Checklist Purpose

Unlike implementation tests, these checklists validate:
- **Requirement Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements captured?
- **Requirement Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and precise?
- **Requirement Consistency**: Do requirements align across documents?
- **Requirement Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively validated?
- **Requirement Traceability**: Are requirements linked to user stories and acceptance criteria?

## Quality Gate

These checklists are designed for **Formal PR Review Gate** depth, meaning:
- All items must be addressed before design/implementation begins
- Each checklist item requires explicit verification or justification
- Gaps identified in checklists must be resolved with spec updates or explicit scope decisions
- Traceability to spec sections is mandatory for all requirements

- Dependencies §4 (Windows versions)
- Clarifications (Automatic degradation, VM/RDP/Terminal Server)
- FR-009 (Process limits)

## Total Quality Coverage

- **Total Checklist Items**: 569
- **Average Traceability**: 75% (items referencing spec sections or explicitly identifying gaps)
- **Coverage Areas**: 6 comprehensive quality dimensions
- **Identified Gaps**: ~150 requirements need specification updates

## Usage Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Review
1. Review each checklist systematically
2. For each item, verify requirement exists and is complete
3. Mark items with gaps or ambiguities

### Phase 2: Gap Resolution
1. For each identified gap, either:
   - Add missing requirement to `spec.md`
   - Document explicit scope exclusion decision
   - Create follow-up clarification question
2. Update checklist traceability references

### Phase 3: Consistency Validation
1. Cross-check requirements across documents
2. Resolve conflicts or inconsistencies
3. Verify alignment between Spec, Plan, Constitution, Dependencies

### Phase 4: Sign-Off
1. All checklist items verified
2. All gaps resolved or explicitly excluded
3. Traceability updated to 100%
4. Formal approval to proceed to implementation

## Maintenance

These checklists should be updated when:
- New requirements are added to the specification
- Clarifications reveal missing requirement details
- Implementation reveals gaps in requirement coverage
- User stories or acceptance criteria are refined

## Cross-References

- **Specification**: `../spec.md`
- **Implementation Plan**: `../plan.md`
- **Task Breakdown**: `../tasks.md`
- **Research**: `../research/`
- **Clarifications**: `../spec.md` (Clarifications section)
