## Dependencies & Execution Order (Part 1)

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (UI Framework)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 3 (Monitoring)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion, can run parallel to Phase 2 (different files)
- **Phase 4 (Process Management)**: Depends on Phases 1, 2, 3 completion

### Parallel Opportunities (Phases 1-4)

- Phase 1: T005, T006, T007 (CI/linting) || T010-T014 (module structure) || T015-T017 (utilities) || T018-T020 (tests)
- Phase 2: T026-T027 (window details) after T021-T025 complete
- Phase 2: T034-T037 (DirectWrite) || T038-T041 (resources) after T028-T033 (D2D core)
- Phase 2: T047-T050 (DPI) || T051-T056 (input) || T057-T061 (layout) after window foundation
- Phase 3: T066-T076 (NtQuery) || T095-T106 (PDH) || T107-T110 (Memory) || T111-T117 (GPU) can all run in parallel
- Phase 3: T139-T142 (integration tests) || T143-T147 (benchmarks) can run in parallel
- Phase 4: T193-T199 (filtering) || T200-T203 (filter UI) after process list basics
- Phase 4: T220-T224 (integration tests) can run in parallel after control implementation

### Critical Path (Phases 1-4)

1. T001-T004 (project setup) → BLOCKS ALL
2. T021-T025 (window foundation) → BLOCKS all UI
3. T028-T033 (D2D core) → BLOCKS rendering
4. T066-T076 (NtQuery) → BLOCKS process enumeration
5. T077-T086 (ProcessStore) → BLOCKS data storage
6. T129-T133 (monitoring coordinator) → BLOCKS metrics collection
7. T185-T192 (process table UI) → BLOCKS user interaction

- Timeline: 5-6 months

**2 Developers (Parallel after Setup)**:
- Dev A: Phases 1 → 2 (UI) → 5 (Visualization) → 7 (Polish UI)
- Dev B: Phases 1 → 3 (Monitoring) → 4 (Process Mgmt) → 6 (Optimization)
- Both: Phase 8 (Testing and release)
- Timeline: 3-4 months

**3+ Developers (Maximum Parallelization)**:
- Dev A: UI track (Phases 1 → 2 → 5 → 7 UI features)
- Dev B: Monitoring track (Phases 1 → 3 → 6 monitoring optimization)
- Dev C: Process management track (Phases 1 → 4 → 6 process optimization)
- All: Phase 7 (Polish) and Phase 8 (Testing and release)
- Timeline: 2-3 months
